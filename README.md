This projects seeks to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context, as well as to learn about a great example of a basic “dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers. This projects represents a good exercise in programming, because of printf's versatility in C. The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.
